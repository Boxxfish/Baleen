# Baleen

### Baleen is a state-of-the-art model for multi-hop reasoning, enabling scalable multi-hop search over massive collections for knowledge-intensive tasks like QA and claim verification.

## Installation

The implementation of Baleen lives as part of the parent [ColBERT](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT/tree/new_api) repository (under its `new_api` branch).

After cloning, make sure you obtain the code for the submodule too:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Please follow the installation instructions from the submodule. Baleen has the same requirements as the parent ColBERT repository.

## Usage

We will update this README with instructions and model checkpoints in the next few hours! Check back or "Watch" the github repo for updates.
